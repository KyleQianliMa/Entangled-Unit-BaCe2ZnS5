# Entangled-Unit-BaCe2ZnS5
Source code of simulating neutron spectra from entangled unit of BaCe2ZnS5

This repo contains the source code and data used to simulate neutron spectra, magnetization, heat capacity from an entangled dimer unit in https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17913. The figures can be created by directly running the source code "SSL_simulation_Ce_final_plots_used_in_paper.py".
